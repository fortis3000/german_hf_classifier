# Sentiment classifier API for German language

## Description
To build this API [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/oliverguhr/german-sentiment-bert) were used.
Image was derived from `huggingface/transformers-pytorch-gpu`, that allows using GPU during prediction.

## How to create an image
### Docker
To compile and run the API use the following commands:

`docker build -t cornelsen .`

`docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 cornelsen`

### Docker-compose
Use docker-compose to make your experiments with API easier. Tweak `docker-compose.yml` settings if needed.

`docker-compose up --build`

To shut the API down use `docker-compose down`

## How to use the endpoint
This API gets JSON as an input. Here is an example:

Input:
```
{
    "text": "Sie f채hrt ein gr체nes Auto."
}
```

Output:
```
{
    "message": "OK",
    "received": "Sie f채hrt ein gr체nes Auto.",
    "score": "neutral"
}
```
You can get additional information on `localhost:8000/docs`.

## What would be the required steps to deploy it in a cloud environment of your choice?

To deploy this solution into the cloud we need:
* Adding proper testing
* Adding CI/CD pipeline
* Add load balancer according to load expectations
